## Intro to Data Analysis and Machine Learning for Engineers eBook

This is an eBook associated with the Data Analysis and Machine Learning section of the EMS506U course taught
to second year engineers at QMUL. The lectures are intended as a brief introduction to the principles and tools
 required for modern data analysis. We will work through from inspecting and cleaning data, to building simple 
models to explore relationships between variables, to building some modern neural networks for analysing images
 and sequences.
